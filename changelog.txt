v2.1.5, 2019-12-24

+ const_value stub feature - allows to return fixed value always

v2.1.4, 2019-11-23

+ support for stub to load corresponding field of returning table/structure

v2.1.1, 2019-11-02
------------------
+ support for structured i_sift_param in stub, e.g. 'is_params-connid'

v2.1.0, 2019-08-25
------------------
+ deep structure loading - major feature, see readme and reference
! source redirection logic change - now redirects to file only if the same MIME is specified in ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SMIME. To make possible redirect specific package only
! move util helpers to public
! internal refactorings

v2.0.5, 2019-04-10
------------------
+ Added ZMOCKUP_LOADER=>ASSERT_VERSION method
+ Added ZMOCKUP_LOADER=>LOAD_RAW_X method

v2.0.3, 2019-03-26
------------------
! Removed dependency from W3MIPOLLER (at ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SWSRC)
+ Added ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SWSRC check for production env (block uploads)

v2.0.2, 2019-01-25
------------------
! version moved to zif_mockup_loader_constants 
+ added `check_version_fits` method

v2.0.1, 2019-01-18
------------------
+ 'create_from_sys_settings' method, takes default paras from `tvarvc` table (maintained with tr. `stvarv`)

v2.0.0-beta3, 2018-09-15
------------------
+ 'proxy' feature for stubber: allows to forward calls through to another object

v2.0.0-beta2, 2018-08-31
------------------
+ BUILD_FILTER: accepts tt_filter and passes it through, allows specifying single value via i_single_value
+ LOAD_DATA accepts data references as container (exporting value is reused, dref must be created)
+ new 'stub' feature: connects global interface and mockup loader via dynamically generated interface implementation. Wow !

v2.0.0-beta, 2018-08-28
------------------
+ support LF line break
+ UX: ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SWSRC can upload files with a button, but requires installed abap_w3mi_poller (https://github.com/sbcgua/abap_w3mi_poller.git)
! mockup_loader split into several classes: ZCL_MOCKUP_LOADER itself, ZCL_MOCKUP_LOADER_STORE - store functionality, ZCL_MOCKUP_LOADER_UTILS - filtering utils
! parsing logic is separated into independent package - abap_data_parser - which is now a prerequisite. Sorry for that. This is for good :)
! exception is now also global - ZCX_MOCKUP_LOADER_ERROR
! ZCL_MOCKUP_LOADER is not singleton anymore and now instantiated with CREATE method - no need as the store functionality moved (ZCL_MOCKUP_LOADER_STORE remains singleton)
! VBA script removed. Instead meet mockup compiler ! Either in native ABAP implementation (https://github.com/sbcgua/mockup_compiler) or in JS (https://github.com/sbcgua/mockup-compiler-js). The ABAP implementation requires abap2xlsx package installed (https://github.com/ivanfemia/abap2xlsx)

v1.1.0, 2018-08-12
------------------
+ support double quotes
+ better date parsing, see I_DATE_FORMAT in reference

v1.0.0, 2017-04-08
------------------
This is more a technical release. It uses stable code of v0.2.1 but the whole repo is migrated from SAPLink to abapGit which is more convenient and modern exchange solution.
Since the code proved to be stable I decided to call it v1.0.0 finally :)

v0.2.1, 2017-04-08
------------------
! No code changes. Just to fix the version before migrating to abapGit from SAPLink nuggets.

v0.2.0, 2016-07-06
------------------
- IMPORTANT ! ZCX_MOCKUP_LOADER_ERROR removed - replaced with local class based on CX_STATIC_CHECK. Cleaner code, less to install.

+ Added gcZipWaitTime constant to PrepareZip.vbs. Addressing zip issues on slower machines.
* Renamed PrepareZip.vbs to excel2txt.vbs
* ZMOCKUP_LOADER_ZAKE now creates refers ZAKE classes dynamically so that it can be compiled in systems where ZAKE is not installed

v0.1.6, 2016-03-11
------------------
+ Text file encoding is not hardcoded UTF16 anymore but can be set in CLASS_SET_PARAMS. UTF16 is still the default. Issue #3
+ More convenient forms of I_WHERE for LOAD_DATA. See Reference.md. Issue #4.
+ Added I_WHERE logic to _RETRIEVE.
! Refactored _RETRIEVE logic.
* Improvements in unit tests - increased coverage to nearly 100%.

v0.1.5, 2016-02-20
------------------
* Minor fixes
+ New filter feature for LOAD_DATA. Now you can pass I_WHERE parameter - a structure of ranges - to filter the output. One of purposes is extracting expected values in a multi-case test (when a table contains answers for several cases). See LOAD_DATA section in REFERENCE.md for more details and also how-to at wiki pages.


v0.1.4, 2016-02-07
------------------
! Nugget moved to 'build' dir, as well as separate slinkees
! Changed amount parsing code @PARSE_FIELD (inspired by Uweku's comment)
! Changed BKPF/BSET tables in unit test to SCARR/SFLIGHT for non-ERP installations (thanks to comment of Uweku)
+ Added ZMOCKUP_LOADER_ZAKE program to automatically build the package (thanks to comment of Uweku)
+ Added handling of raw data type (X) (thanks to comment of Uweku)
+ Added CLASS_SET_PARAMS method to set amount separators

v0.1.3, 2015-12-23
------------------
! Swicthed priority for SET/GET parameters to be higher than CLASS_SET_SOURCE()
! Minor improvements in error messages
+ Added unit test for source redirection behaviour
+ Added transaction ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SWSRC or the ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SWITCH_SOURCE program
+ Added button Get SU3 value to read file path from user saved parameters

PrepareZip.vbs:
! Improved console output, statistics and formatting
+ Added -bd parameter to choose build directory (for uncompressed data) other than current
+ Added color support. Requires ANSICON installed (https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon)
+ Added -i parameter to explicitly include a directory to processed output data structure

v0.1.2, 2015-12-23
------------------
+ Added SET/GET parameters ZMOCKUP_LOADER_STYPE and ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SPATH for temporary load source re-direction
+ Added program ZMOCKUP_LOADER_SWITCH_SOURCE to switch the parameters in a convenient way (see README.md)

v0.1.1, 2015-12-06
------------------
! change exception message from 0M(500) to SY(499)
+ improvement of VBS script - added feature to explicitly include directory to zip
